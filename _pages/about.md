# üòâ About Me
I am an undergraduate student pursuing dual degrees in Information Engineering and Public Administration at Shandong University. My research focuses on cutting-edge applications of Large Language Models in software engineering, including code translation, automated program repair, and commit message generation. I have led multiple research projects collaborating with Peking University's Key Laboratory of High-Confidence Software Technology and Shandong University's Research Center for Architecture and Embedded Systems, under the guidance of **Prof. Zhen Yang (Shandong University)** and **Prof. Zhi Jin (Peking University, IEEE Fellow)**. I have published in top-tier venues including *IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering* (CCF-A).<a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RiFZe1YAAAAJ&hl=en=zh-CN'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url|url_encode}}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=Citations">
